# WARNING
YOU CANNOT PLAY GAMES LIKE CSGO OR CSGO 2 SINCE THE LATEST VERSION OF STEAM IS REQUIRED YES OR YES (POSIBLY ALL VALVE GAMES WITH ITS VAC, try left 4 dead 2 and it works (top game)

### Characteristics:

- An old version of Steam is used that consumes less system resources by not having so many new things.
- Many things are disabled to optimize resource consumption.

#### If you are antisocial and have no friends in life or on Steam, click here to download your personalized Steam <3.
[Download Steam for antisocialsðŸ˜’](https://github.com/mtytyx/Steam-Debloat/releases/download/steamv1.20/Steam.for.Antisocials.bat)

<p></p>

### 1+ Well, starting with this guide, the first thing you should do is download the bat file here if you are a person WITH FRIENDS.
[Download Steam for people WITH FRIENDSðŸ˜Ž](https://github.com/mtytyx/Steam-Debloat/releases/download/steamv1.20/Steam-Github-mtytyx.bat)
<p></p>

### 2+ The bat is automatic so you won't have to do anything until the end.

### 3+ In this step you have to download QuickPatch from Tiberium Fusion to make the friends list work.

<p></p>

### 4+ Then open steam.bat from the desktop, you can check if the friends list is working.

### 5+ This step is only to further optimize steam.
#### Copy and paste if you are interested in my setup.

##### Why did this happened? Because `-cef-force-32bit` was added to the startup parameters, which disables the launch of `steamwebhelper`, which is used for the friends window (I think Workshop doesn't work without webhelper), among other things , disable having it.
