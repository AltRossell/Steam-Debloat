If you are antisocial and have no friends either in life or on steam I made you a custom bat file <3

1+ Well starting the github the first thing to do is just download the bat file/batch file in release.

2+ The bat is automatic so you won't have to do anything until the end.

3+ Look in the task manager ctrl+shift+esc in the background if there are no steam processes running

4+ After it will be FixedSteamFriendsUI Quick Patcher.exe
Press the patch button and wait for it to appear that it has been patched.

5+ Log in because it is a steam in another location than the default one

6+ After logging in and Steam has started, you can check if the friends list works, if it works, go to the next step.
6.5+ If it doesn't work for you, keep reading, close Steam from the taskbar and wait for the processes to close (also the Tiberium program will tell you that Steam is still in the background) After logging in and Steam has started, you can check if the friends list works, if it works, go to the next step 7+. If it doesn't work for you, keep reading, close Steam from the taskbar and wait for the processes to close (also the Tiberium program will tell you that Steam is still in the background) just patch it again and open Steam if, due to strange cases, it still doesn't work. The friends list works, patch it with version 2.0.2 and if for no rational reason it still works, patch it with 1.2.0 and if it still doesn't work, redo all the steps

7+ This step is only to further optimize steam
