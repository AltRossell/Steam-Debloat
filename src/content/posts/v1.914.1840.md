# Changelog

- **Complete Migration to WPF Desktop Application**: Replaced PowerShell script with modern Windows application featuring Material Design interface, real-time Steam detection, and non-blocking operations.
- **Visual Interface with Real-Time Updates**: Added system information panel that automatically refreshes Steam installation status, configuration states, and admin privileges with color-coded indicators.
- **Async Operation Management**: Implemented asynchronous processing for all Steam operations with cancellable progress overlay, preventing UI freezing during installations and updates.
- **Enhanced Steam Detection System**: Added timer-based automatic detection that checks for Steam installations every minute across multiple common paths and registry locations.
- **Built-in Uninstall Functionality**: New uninstall feature completely removes all optimization configurations, shortcuts, and Steam V2 directory while preserving game libraries and user data.
- **Improved Dual Version Support**: Enhanced "Both Versions" mode with automatic UI adaptation, separate configuration management for Steam 2022 and Steam 2025 installations.
- **Smart Configuration Management**: All operations now create/overwrite configuration files with mode tracking, ensuring consistency between selected modes and deployed configurations.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages, automatic cleanup of temporary files, and graceful operation cancellation.
