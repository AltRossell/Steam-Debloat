# Changelog

- **Updated Steam Uninstaller**: Added `UpdateSteamToJuly2025Async()` in `UninstallService.cs` to automatically update Steam to the July 2025 version after removing optimizations. Ensures a clean Steam installation post-uninstall.  
- **Resolved Compiler Warning**: Removed the unused `_disposed` field and implemented an empty `Dispose()` method to eliminate CS0414 warnings.   
- **Enhanced Uninstaller Behavior**: Performs full cleanup of optimization configurations, removes Steam V2 directory if present, cleans shortcuts and temporary files, and shows progress messages during the Steam update process.
